Using mapping geometry for displaying statistics on maps.

For centuries we've been using latitiude and longitude for navigation, but in this age of computing things are getting a little snarky. You see, latitude corresponds to the Y axis and longitude to the X axis. For this reason, most software requires the parameters in the order (longitude, latitude) despite the clear history of (latitude, longitude) so that (longitude, latitude) can be easily plotted as (x,y). This is what happens when programmers ignore cultural influence and standards and decide to make the universe change to suite them.
